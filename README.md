# Hi — I'm Brayden Graham (BR4YD3N-G) 👋

> Firmware Test Engineer & Software Engineer — building reliable embedded systems and high-performance game engines.

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Firmware Test Engineer who strengthens product quality through repeatable, automated testing and robust CI. I also contribute as a Software Engineer at Krypto Industries, where I help design and build game engines and other high-performance software. I focus on bridging hardware and software gaps with pragmatic, maintainable tooling and test infrastructure.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: firmware test automation, CI integration, and engine tooling at Krypto Industries.  
- 🌱 I’m learning: advanced systems-level testing, performance profiling, and scalable test infrastructure.  
- 💬 Ask me about: embedded test design, HIL setups, test harnesses, and game engine systems.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I optimize long-running test setups to reduce validation time and increase throughput.

## 🧠 What I Do
I design and implement testing strategies that catch issues early and make firmware releases predictable.

- Develop firmware test automation (unit, integration, system)  
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and emulation-based verification  
- Build and maintain CI pipelines for firmware releases  
- Test harnesses, instrumentation, and reliability testing  
- Collaborate with firmware and hardware teams to reproduce and triage defects
